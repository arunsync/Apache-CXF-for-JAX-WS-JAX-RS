SOAP WS can be created in 2 ways.
=================================
  1. Java First (Maven Archetype: cxf-jaxws-javafirst)
  2. WSDL First (Maven Archetype: cxf-jaxws-wsdlfirst)
  
  1. Building Java First WS (Hellow World Service)
      a. Open STS
      b. File-> New Maven Project
      c. Filter with "cxf-jaxws-javafirst". Make sure the Group Id is "org.apache.cxf.archetype" and click Next
      d. Provide Group Id and other details for your projects and click finish
      e. Now you can see the project is created and it has wsdl and service files created.
      f. Add Tomcat server in STS servers area
      g. Right click on the project Run As-> Run on server-> Boom
      h. You can see the Web service explored opened with the Hello World service
      i. If we want to create a POJO for the service in which the WSDL should be generated, this approach won't work. Go to the next section below.
      
  2. Building Java First WS (Customer Service)
